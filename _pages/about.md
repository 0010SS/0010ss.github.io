I might be a **GEEK** (<strike>Nerd</strike>). My drive for **self-actualization** compels me to use my strengths to assist everyone on the planet, with technology serving as an excellent tool to enhance productivity and simplify our livesâ€”plus, isn't everything tech-related incredibly cool? ðŸ˜Ž

My research is centered on **Artificial Intelligence**, specifically **Natural Language Processing** and **Computer Vision/Graphics**, seeing how they've changed our society (and my love for computer science that began at age 8, aspiring to be one of those hackers in hoodies and masks typing away on a black terminal ðŸ’»). However, <u>I am keen and eager to explore any technological area that can make our world a better place, from biology to physics to computer science.</u>

Yet, I might not be a **NERD**. I care about the societal and ethical issues related to technology as much as I care about the technology itself. I activtely surf on Twitter and [r\singularity](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/). One of my fundamental goals is to **make technology accessible to everyone**, so that every person can be more productive and lead a better life. Check out my Twitter account where I demystify obscure AI concepts using intuitive language that everyone can understand.


I am **vibrant** in my daily life. I like Steph Curry (I even have his autobiography ðŸ˜‹), love the Air Force 1 shoe lineðŸ‘Ÿ, and dream of driving a Mercedes AMG GTR ðŸš”. Above all, my favorite book series is "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"â€”it's simply **AMAZING**. If you share any of these interests, I'd love to connect!
