**Human culture**, with its ancient relics and traditions, is as enthralling and enigmatic as the technological realm. My fascination spans from Eastern martial arts—yes, I run my own Tai Chi club—to Western practices like Tarot. Tarot, a centuries-old deck used for divination, also serves as a medium for self-exploration and growth.

Recently, personality assessments like the **MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator)** have gained traction on Chinese social media platforms such as the Red Book. These platforms buzz with discussions on MBTI types, often used to tag and interpret personal behaviors—a practice that's as contentious as it is captivating.

This sparked an intriguing thought: *Why not use Tarot for personality analysis?* Each card embodies distinct situations and characteristics, potentially offering insightful personality reflections. Collaborating with a Tarot connoisseur friend, we crafted a unique predictive process—kudos to **William Li** for his insightful contributions.

This brainstorming led to the creation of our web app, a platform where users can draw three Tarot cards to reveal insights into their persona. Designed for simplicity and ease, the app sports a clean interface, straightforward instructions, and concise card explanations. Although it's my first venture into web app development, using Blazor WebAssembly, and might have some rough edges, I am proud of what we've achieved. 

To my surprise, the app quickly amassed over 1,000 users, garnering acclaim for its insightful and accurate personality analyses. Users exclaim how the app was able to unveil their concealed traits and personalities. This success underscored the potential of revitalizing ancient wisdom through modern technology and ideation. I learnt from this success about the power of culture,ancient relics when it is promoted in a modern way, both in the aspect of technology and ideaation. Inspired by this, I'm keen to delve further into the synergy between ancient culture and contemporary tech, aiming to discover how this fusion can positively impact society.
